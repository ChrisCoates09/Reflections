1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it? 

It initializes an empty Git repository at the end of the path. You need it to have a place to store your commits.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is where files are moved in preparation of being committed.
